# Module 3 - Lesson 5 - Python File Handling
Author: Elizabeth Yates

In this repository, I'm completing the following assignment: 

## 1. Exploring Python's OS Module

Objective: The goal of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of the OS module in Python.

### Task 1: Directory Inspector (directory_inspector.py)

Problem Statement: Create a Python script that lists all files and subdirectories in a given directory. 
Your script should prompt the user for the directory path and then display the contents.

Code Example:

    import os

    def list_directory_contents(path):
        # List and print all files and subdirectories in the given path

Expected Outcome: 

- The script should correctly list all files and subdirectories in the specified directory. 
- Handle exceptions for invalid paths or inaccessible directories.
