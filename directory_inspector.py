### Task 1: Directory Inspector

# Problem Statement: Create a Python script that lists all files and subdirectories in a given directory. 
# Your script should prompt the user for the directory path and then display the contents.
# 
# Expected Outcome: 
# - The script should correctly list all files and subdirectories in the specified directory. 
# - Handle exceptions for invalid paths or inaccessible directories.

import os

def list_directory_contents(path):
    # List and print all files and subdirectories in the given path
    pass

def main():
    path = ""
    list_directory_contents(path)
